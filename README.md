logss
=====

This is a small tool to log data to a Google Spreadsheet.  Google Spreadsheets are very handy for manipulating data, but it's less easy to insert data programmatically.

In order to use this, you'll need the [python gdata client][pygdata] in `PYTHONPATH`, e.g.

    $ export PYTHONPATH="/opt/google/gdata-2.0.14/src"
    $ python logss.py "Spreadsheet Name" col1:val1 col2:val2 â€¦

If you need to know what the valid column names are, leave off the data from the command line.

    $ python logss.py "Spreadsheet Name"
    col1
    col2

TODO
----

Right now this is a proof of concept, and there are many enhancements needed:

 - Use OAuth so we don't have to prompt for a password each time.
 - Allow specification of a spreadsheet by either name or key parameter.
 - Allow choosing a worksheet.
 - Read data from stdin as well as command line.
